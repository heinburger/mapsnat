	config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 55657


	#[WHY?] 1. Forward port 80 to host the static files on port 55656 (656 fairview school lane)
	#       2. I am using 55,000's because Justin is amazing (also i think it is because high numbers won't fuck with your computer's goings-ons)
	#       3. The forwarding of ports 25 and 465 is for mail (need a way for the smtp server to talk to the virtual machine)


	#[REMEMBER] sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 465 -j REDIRECT --to-port 55465

	# Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
